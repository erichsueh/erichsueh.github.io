					<button class="accordion accodiansizing accordianfloatleft">About Me</button>
					<div class="acordianpanel accodiansizing accordianfloatleft">
					  <p>Who am I? That's the million dollar question I suppose, one that is hard to define and everchanging. I am a Computer Engineer/Programmer, but if you're on this page you already knew that. I'm what my parents love to call, a banana, with most of my life living in Metro-Vancouver Canada. Personality wise, I'm more inclined say I'm a fairly calm and mellow guy, able to roll with the punches. My flexibility I would say is my greatest asset, and somewhat of a weakness. Because of my willingness to work on anything, I have lots of little bits of experience in all sections with regards to programming. For work, I've corrected data issues using SQL, set up NexOne's deployment process, created websites using Umbraco (a CMS), bugfixed & troubleshooted web applications, the list goes on. As to why I'd describe it as a weakness, it would be my time is always pulled in multiple different directions on a daily basis. Speaking of work, my co-workers describe me as a reliable coworker. I do whats necessary. If I need to wake up in the middle of the night to solve a major issue, I do so. If a teammate needs help, I schedule some time to help them.
					  <br>
					  Outside of work though, I'm a fairly happy-go-lucky person. A person with a lot of laughter. I also heavily place value on self improvement. I believe that regardless of what I do or what happens, there's always something I could do to improve, something I could do better next time. I'll never get something on the first try, nor even the 5th try, but I'll always strive to improve myself.</p>

						- Swimming - "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times" At age 23, I already became a Swim Instructor. How did I get there you ask? Well, age 4 I almost drowned. My journey with water is one of the most ironic ones. From a life threatening situation, to one where I have both the skills and know how to save others. p>
